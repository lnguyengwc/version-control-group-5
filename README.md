A program returning the user's name and age.
Contributors include Ly and Emily.

This software prints out the name and age that the user inputs in a statement that says "Name: <inputed name> Age: <inputed age>".

To install, copy and paste the code in the code.py file into any IDE that is compatible with Python.
  
To use, when prompted to enter a name, enter a name, and when prompted to enter an age, enter an age. We don't have exception handling so you must enter a string for the first input and an integer for the second.
